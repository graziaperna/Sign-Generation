This project seeks to make a significant contribution by developing a unified framework that processes and encodes these two modalities—text and audio—into cohesive multimodal representations. 
The research will explore various techniques for encoding and aligning these input types, with the goal of producing natural and contextually relevant sign language gestures. 
Ultimately, this study aims to create a more effective and efficient model for sign language generation that can be applied in real-world applications, improving communication for individuals with hearing impairments.
To achieve the objectives outlined in the previous section, this study employs a comprehensive approach that integrates multiple datasets. These datasets consist of transcripts, audio recordings, and motion annotation files, all derived from the same video source, ensuring consistency and temporal alignment across the modalities.
